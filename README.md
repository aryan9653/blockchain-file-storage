# Decentralized File Storage

## Overview
This project is a decentralized file storage solution that leverages blockchain technology to provide secure, transparent, and immutable data storage. Built using Solidity smart contracts and deployed on the Ethereum network, it allows users to upload, store, and retrieve files in a decentralized manner.

## Features
- **Decentralized Storage**: Eliminates the need for centralized servers by using blockchain-based storage solutions.
- **Security & Transparency**: Ensures data integrity with cryptographic hashing and immutable records.
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Uses Solidity smart contracts to manage file metadata and access control.
- **Ethereum-Based**: Utilizes Ethereum blockchain for secure file storage management.

## Technologies Used
- **Solidity**: For writing smart contracts.
- **Ethereum**: As the blockchain platform.
- **IPFS**: For decentralized file storage.
- **Web3.js**: To interact with the blockchain.
- **React.js**: For the frontend (if applicable).
- **Node.js & Express.js**: For backend services (if applicable).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/decentralized-file-storage.git
   cd decentralized-file-storage
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Deploy smart contracts to Ethereum:
   ```bash
   truffle migrate --network rinkeby
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage
1. Connect your Ethereum wallet (MetaMask recommended).
2. Upload files to the decentralized storage system.
3. Retrieve and manage stored files securely via the blockchain.

## Smart Contract Overview
The main smart contract (`FileStorage.sol`) includes:
- **uploadFile**: Allows users to upload file metadata.
- **getFile**: Retrieves file information securely.
- **deleteFile**: Removes file access (if required).
